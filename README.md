# memo
a nostalgic callback to the perl scripts pre-blogging era

## why
I have a lot of fond memories of these old Japanese perl scripts that were the foundations of a lot of personal sites circa 2000. Most of them repurposed bbs scripts into diaries, and had spin off in the form of oekaki scripts like bbsnote. They encouraged dabbling in html and furthered a lot of creativity in themes and skins for these scripts. I got my start in learning html and css as a child by digging into these.

This is not intended to be "efficient" and "well-written" in the modern sense. My aim is to replicate most of these old methods of scripting whiling maintaining better security. I've purposely chosen to adhere to these old ways by design, which is why there is no database or easy editing of entries.
